    <p>Chorten Kora, Yangtse. 1750m altitude. Three minutes from the town. Built over a period of 12 years around 1740 by Lama Ngawang Loday. The chorten was modelled after Boudhanath stupa in Nepal, which the lama carved out of a radish. Differences between the Chorten Kora and Boudhanath stupas are reportedly due to distortion of the model as it shrunk on the return journey of the lama to Bhutan. The pinnacle was originally carved out of a huge stone, which Lama Shacha Gyalpo wanted to replace with a gilded cupola. No one could think of a way to bring down the pinnacle. So, the lama performed prayers during the day and the stone miraculously descended at night. It is still found beside the chorten.<br> Locals believe that an 8 year Dakini girl was sealed alive of her own free will in the chorten as an offering from the Dakpa people of Tawang, Arunachal Pradesh. Dakpas come for circumambulation on the 15th day of the 1st month. Bhutanese celebrate their Kora on the 30th of the 1st Bhutanese month.Chorten Kora, Yangtse. 1750m altitude.
