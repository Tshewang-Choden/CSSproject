        Each winter the people of Bhutan’s Phobjikha Valley await the return of Black-necked Cranes.
         The stately four-foot-tall birds migrate from their breeding grounds in the upper Tibetan 
         Plateau to this remote timber-lined bowl surrounded by massive Himalayan peaks, and roost 
         there until spring amid the alpine wetlands. To the Buddhists of this tiny kingdom, 
         the birds are heavenly emissaries, avatars of long-gone ancestors and lost loved ones, 
         signifying longevity, peace, and prosperity. The graceful birds are so culturally
          important that they’re painted on the sides of homes and businesses throughout the country. In Phobjikha, farmers believe the birds’ presence ensures healthy crops, and tourists travel to the remote valley from around the world to see the cranes.

So when the birds showed up late last year, “everybody was very worried,”
 says ecologist Rebecca Pradhan of the Royal Society for the Protection of Nature (RSPN), 
 a nonprofit in Bhutan.Phobjikha is one of the last strongholds of the threatened Black-necked Crane, a close cousin to the endangered Whooping Crane of North America. The species, only discovered in 1876 due to its remote alpine range in China, Tibet, Bhutan, and India, is vulnerable. Across South Asia, there are as few as 5,000 of the birds in the wild. Grazing, agriculture, and hydroelectricity have all taken a toll on the high-altitude wetlands that the birds depend on,
  and climate change may further alter their habitat.

    The annual Black-Necked Crane festival is celebrated at the courtyard of Gangtey Goenpa in Phobjikha valley. The festival is an occasion for the locals to rejoice and celebrate the arrival of this endangered and majestic bird which becomes an inseparable part in their daily lives during the winter months. The annual blacknecked crane festival is organized to generate awareness and understanding on the importance of conserving the endangered Black-Necked Cranes. The festival includes cultural programs such as folk songs and dances (some with black-necked crane themes) and mask dances performed by the local people, crane dances and environmental conservation-themed dramas and songs by school children.</p>
